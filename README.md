# smiles-rnn-from-scratch
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and sample from an RNN-based generative model for small molecules, using only low-level libraries (NumPy, RDKit). It includes tokenization, manual backpropagation, and an Adam optimizerâ€”no heavyweight deep learning frameworks needed. Perfect for learning the internals of sequence modeling in a cheminformatics context!
